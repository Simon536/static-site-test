## Welcome to sdg.id.au

This site was created for the purpose of experimenting with GitHub Pages and a custom domain.

## [Game of Life](https://gol.sdg.id.au)

Closely based on [this](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html) tutorial, it is a simple project while I learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## [Chess Engine](https://chess.sdg.id.au/chess)

This is a basic chess engine that I wrote in C# in 2016, and have now ported to run in the browser using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
